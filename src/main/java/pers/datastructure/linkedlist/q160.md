# 找出两个链表的交点
## Intersection of Two Linked Lists (Easy)

[LeetCode链接](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/description/)

### 题目描述：

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

begin to intersect at node c1.

 

#### Example 1:

![img](https://pict-store.oss-cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/img/20200421092630.png)

Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3

Output: Reference of the node with value = 8

Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.

#### Example 2:

Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1

Output: Reference of the node with value = 2

Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.

#### Example 3:

![img](https://pict-store.oss-cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/img/20200421092647.png)

Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2

Output: null

Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.

#### Notes:

- If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
- The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
- You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
- Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

### 所需知识
- 时间复杂度

- 空间复杂度

### 解题思路
#### 情况一. 两个链表存在交点
如图所示，在两个链表相交的情况下，设链表 A 的长度为 a + c，链表 B 的长度为 b + c，其中 c 为尾部的公共部分长度，可以得出
a + c + b = b + c + a = 8.

当访问 A 链表的指针到达链表尾部时，令指针又从 B 的头部访问链表 B；类似的，当访问 B 的指针到达链表末尾时，令其指针又从 A 的头部访问链表A 。
在此例子中，当第9次时两个链表的指针可以同时访问到交点。

#### 情况二. 两个链表不存在交点
如图所示，在两个链表不相交的情况下，设链表 A 的长度为 a = 3，链表 B 的长度为 b = 2，可以得出
a + b = b + a = 5，在此例子中，当第6次循环时，两个指针同时为null.
